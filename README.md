# Unemployment_and_Participation_Rates_from_FRED


## Motivation

This project is to delve into the world of performing basic EDA. It is beginner friendly & easy to follow, with reproducable examples and will help anyone getting started using python for data analysis. 

## What data are we handling?

Participation and unemployment rates are important economic indicators that provide insights into the health of the labor market and the overall economy. The participation rate measures the percentage of the working-age population that is actively participating in the labor force, either by being employed or actively seeking work. On the other hand, the unemployment rate measures the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed but actively seeking work.

These two indicators are important because they can help policymakers and analysts understand the current state of the economy and make informed decisions about economic policy. For example, if the participation rate is declining while the unemployment rate is increasing, it may indicate that job opportunities are becoming scarce, and more people are becoming discouraged from seeking employment. In such a case, policymakers may consider implementing measures to stimulate job creation and improve economic growth.

Similarly, if the participation rate is increasing while the unemployment rate is decreasing, it may indicate that the labor market is becoming more robust, and more people are finding employment. This may signal a stronger economy and potentially lead to increased consumer spending and economic growth.

Overall, participation and unemployment rates are essential indicators of labor market health and can provide valuable insights into the overall health of the economy.
